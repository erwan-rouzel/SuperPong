SUPER PONG v1.1
===============

by Erwan Rouzel, aKa nop
for TI-89 under doorsos

This is a game which uses the concept of one of the first 
video-games (Pong). This is my first 68k assembly program.


Setup
-----

You just have to upload the spong.89z file to your TI. You must
own the following libs : userlib, graphlib ; and of course, you must
have doorsos (tested with the Final Release, but it should also work 
with older versions).

The game 
--------

I think it is not necessary to explain the rules :-)

I just point out how the ball behave :
 - it accelerates whenever it touches a bat, so its speed may
   become considerable after a wide number of exchanges ;
 - you can make it having some effects, which depend on the way
   you resent the ball : if you move your bat through the same 
   direction of the ball, you make it having a vertical acceleration,
   through the opposite direction a deceleration. If you do not
   understand, try it out ! 

Two players can play on the same TI, or one versus an AI (which skill
is modifiable). Here are the keys :

 - left player : 
    * up   : 2nd
    * down : Home

 - right player :
    * up   : up arrow
    * down : down arrow   

 - divers :
    * pause : enter
    * abort game : esc

History 
-------
v1.1 :
Some improvement in bat speed handling, and some unuseful peace of
code have been removed. This is the first *real* public release

v1.0 :
A kind of bêta which nearly no one had seen since I didn't 
published it on ticalc.org
